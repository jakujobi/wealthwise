II.  Scope

A.  Background of system

Managing personal finances can be challenging without the right tools and guidance. The

WealthWise financial advising platform is designed to help users take control of their financial

health  by  providing  a  secure  and  efficient  system.  It  allows  users  to  log  in,  make  transactions,

schedule appointments with professional financial advisors, and access financial tools to manage

their  budget  and  savings  effectively.  By  enabling  clients  to  use  WealthWise  services  from

anywhere,  this  system  reduces  management  costs  while  ensuring  a  smooth  and  convenient

experience.

B.  Existing Software

1.

Envestnet MoneyGuide

•  About:  MoneyGuide  had  about  a  third  of  the  market  share  for  financial  advisors  in

2023, making them one of the most popular app platforms in the industry. Their goal is

to make it easier for advisors to collect client information, analyze finances, and create

strategies to help clients achieve their financial goals.

3.

eMoney Pro

•  About: “For over 20 years, we’ve worked with thousands of financial professionals to

create products  and  services  that  make  a  difference. We  listen,  research,  and  test  to

ensure we deliver continuous enhancements to our core products while exploring new

Decision Center, Plan summary. Education and practice management, onboarding and

training, client support, data migration services.

•  Resources: case studies, news, webinars, blog, summit.

C.  Solution

From the existing software, we suggest building a web application that lets users access

the system online through their web browser. This will help us manage connection flow and control

access remotely. We also include some features already available on the market, like basic financial

tools, and add custom features based on client requests. The project will not include these features:

virtual  Bootcamps,  social  security  optimization,  risk  management,  …  those  didn’t  list  in  the

proposal. The  project  will  have  a  user  interface  (UI)  and  user  experience  (UX)  design  that  are

considered clear and intuitive.

To handle client requests, we suggest setting up a local server for the application. This will

allow it to process multiple requests within the building without relying on third-party services,

reducing security risks and the chance of a data breach while also increasing control, reliability,

and availability.

III.  Plan

A.  Functional Work Breakdown Structure (FWBS)

Figure 2. Functional Work Breakdown Structure (FWBS)

Above is the functional work breakdown structure. It shows the progression of work as the

development progresses. Purple represents top-level systems, green represents sub-level systems,

and orange is the lowest-level subsystems. The development will begin at “Start” and progress to

“Integration Testing,” “Delivery,” and finally to “End.”

B.  Milestones

•  Development begins: Occurs at the start of the development process which signifies

that work has started. Expected completion date: January 27th, 2025.

10

•  System accepts transactions: Occurs upon the completion of the 6.1 Payment Gateway

integration  which  signifies  that  payment  capabilities  are  implemented.  Expected

completion date: February 12th, 2025.

•  On-system  communication:  Occurs  upon  the  completion  of  1.8  Messaging  of

Notification  which  signifies  that  users  can  now  communicate  with  each  other  and

notifications can be sent. Expected completion date: March 5th, 2025.

•  Website Well past 60%: Occurs upon the completion of 1.6 subscription management.

At this point in development, it cannot be argued the website is less than 60% complete.

Expected Date: March 23rd, 2025.

•  Website completion: Occurs upon the completion of 4.2 learning tools. At this point,

the Website is complete. Expected Date: April 16th, 2025.

C.  Critical Path Analysis

11

Above is the critical path analysis. The 2 leftmost columns are the starting columns, which

Figure 3. Network diagram with slack hour.

were  broken  down  into  2  columns  to  fit  in  as  few  screenshots  as  possible.  Lines  of  any  color

represent dependencies where the box on the right side of the arrow with the arrowhead pointing

to it is dependent on the left box with the tail end of the arrow attached to it. Lines are colored to

more easily determine where the arrows originate and point. The box fields are as follows from

left to right and top to bottom as read: early start, duration, early finish, item number, late start,

slack time, and late finish. Ant box with the slack time box colored red is part of the critical path.

D.  Project Schedule (Gantt chart)

Figure 4. Project Schedule with Gantt chart view

Above is the Gantt chart. To the left side is each item number with the name of said item

number. Each item number corresponds to the blue box directly horizontal to it. Along the top is a

timeline that displays the date at a given vertical. Each line represents approximately a week. The

Purple diamonds are milestones that correspond to the text on the right side directly horizontal to

it.

13

IV.  Estimation

A.  Estimation size and cost

The estimated time for completion of the WealthWise website is 9.3 months. Assuming it

costs  us  $5,000  per  staff  month,  the  project  cost  is  Shestimated  at  $214,500.  Fortunately,  our

innovative business model allows us to pay our staff nothing, bringing costs down to $0. Although

total completion may take 9 months, the Arqer team is confident we can reach 60% completion in

3 months.

B.  Model and Calculation

To determine our estimates, we used the Intermediate COCOMO I model. The COCOMO

model uses project type and thousands of lines of code (KLOC) to estimate effort, delivery time,

average staffing, and cost.

To start, the effort estimation was calculated. The project type was determined to be semi-

detached, giving us a value of 3.0 for a and 1.12 for b. To determine the KLOC that was needed,

the project was broken into sections, and each section was given an estimation of KLOC.

The total estimation for the lines of code needed is 7,250. The next step was to determine

the effort multipliers. In general, we chose effort multipliers that reflected our limited experience

as developers and with website software.

The effort multiples are all multiplied together for a total effort adjustment factor or C of

1.556. Using equation 1, the effort estimation was 42.9 months.

𝐸 = 𝑎 (𝐾𝐿𝑂𝐶)𝑏 ∗ 𝐶

(1)

The cost estimate is calculated by multiplying the effort estimation by the cost of a staff

month (s), as shown in equation 2. Assuming the cost of a staff month is $5,000, the project would

cost $214,500. However, our enthusiastic employees are willing to work for free, bringing the cost

of a staff month down and the total cost to $0.

15

𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 = 𝐸 ∗ 𝑠
Using  the  effort  estimation,  the  delivery  time  is  simple  enough  to  calculate.  Using  the

(2)

project  type  we  determined  before  as  semi-detached,  the  COCOMO  model  gives  us  two  more

variables: c = 2.5 and d = 0.35. Using equation 3, the delivery time is calculated as 9.3 months.

𝑇𝐷𝐸𝑉 = 𝑐 (𝐸)𝑑

(3)

The average staffing is the average number of staff needed during development. To find it,

effort estimation is divided by delivery time. Using equation 4, the average staff was calculated as

4.6 staff. Our team comprises four people, so we may consider hiring an outside contractor to help

with some tasks.

C.  Financial Advantage

𝑆 =

𝐸
𝑇𝐷𝐸𝑉

(4)

This  website  can  offer  numerous  financial  advantages  to  Wealthwise,  significantly

enhancing its business growth and customer engagement. The primary benefit is its ability to reach

a  broader  audience,  allowing  potential  clients  from  various  locations  to  discover  and  access

Wealthwise’s financial consulting services easily. By consolidating all essential information and

services in one accessible online hub, the website simplifies customer experience and strengthens

the company’s online presence and credibility.

Beyond its marketing and informational value, the website also provides an opportunity

for  direct  revenue  generation.  Offering  a  budget  calculator  through  paid  subscriptions  adds  an

income stream while delivering valuable tools to help users manage their finances more effectively.
